# Singly Linked list in JavaScript

Linked List is a data structure consisting of a group of vertices (nodes) which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each vertex is composed of a data and a reference (link) to the next vertex in the sequence or to null. A singly linked list contains a head, tail and length property.

Linked List and its variations are used as underlying data structure to implement List, Stack, Queue, and Deque ADTs

## Lists Vs Arrays

### Lists
- Do not have indexes
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

### Arrays
- Indexed in order
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at specific index

## Methods
- Push: Adds a node to the end of the list
- Pop: Removes a node from the end of the list
- Shift: Removes a node from the beginning of the list
- Unshift: Adds a node at the beginning of the list
- Get: Retrieves a node by its position in the list
- Set: Changes the value of a node based on its position on the list
- Insert: Adds a new node in the specified position
- Remove: Removes a node from the list, based on its position
- Reverse: Reverses the order of the list
